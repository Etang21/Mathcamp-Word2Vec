# Mathcamp-Word2Vec
A Mathcamp 2017 Word2Vec project in Java!

Using the existing Word2Vec outputs that Google provides from its Google News corpus, we're building a program to play the role of Spymaster in the board game Codenames.

Along the way, we've also built tools to:
- Find the words with maximum values in component x (for any x).
- Compare headlines and suggest similar ones
- Solve analogies (e.g. Male is to King as Female is to . . .)
- Determine the cosine similarity between words
- Find a list of words similar to a given word
